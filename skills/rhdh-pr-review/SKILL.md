name: rhdh-pr-review
description: Test PR changes on a live RHDH cluster. Fetches CI-built images from PR comments, checks cluster status (deploying if needed), swaps images into the running deployment, and generates a targeted review checklist from the diff. Use when asked to review an rhdh-operator PR, test PR changes on a cluster, swap CI images, or deploy PR images for testing. Also use when user mentions "operator PR", "review PR", or "test this PR on my cluster". Currently supports rhdh-operator PRs.

<cli_setup>
This skill uses the orchestrator CLI for activity tracking. **Set up first:**

```bash
RHDH=../../rhdh/scripts/rhdh
```
</cli_setup>

<essential_principles>

<principle name="ensure_cluster">
Always verify the user has a running RHDH cluster with `oc` access before attempting image swaps.
Check `oc whoami` and `oc get deployment -A | grep rhdh-operator` first.
If no cluster at all (`oc whoami` fails), **provision one via rhdh-test-instance PR workflow** — comment `/test deploy operator 1.9 4h` on a PR in `redhat-developer/rhdh-test-instance` using `gh pr comment`. No local clone needed.
If cluster exists but no RHDH, deploy using rhdh-test-instance locally (`make install-operator && make deploy-operator`).
Don't just tell the user to set things up — do it.
</principle>

<principle name="use_pr_comment_images">
Extract image URLs from PR comments posted by CI — never construct image URLs manually.
The tag format includes PR number + commit SHA, which only CI knows.
See `references/operator-pr-images.md` for extraction commands.
</principle>

<principle name="patch_not_redeploy">
Swap images on a running deployment rather than redeploying from scratch.
For non-OLM installs, use `oc set image`. For OLM-managed installs, patch the CSV — never patch the Deployment directly as OLM will overwrite it. This is faster and preserves existing state (Backstage CRs, config, Keycloak).

### PR Review Tasks

*For testing PR changes on a live RHDH cluster*

1. **Review rhdh-operator PR** — Swap CI images into cluster and get review checklist

**Wait for response before proceeding.**

### PR Review Routes

| Response | Workflow |
|----------|----------|
| 1, "operator", "rhdh-operator", a PR number, "review" | Route to `workflows/review-operator-pr.md` |

**To route:** Read `workflows/review-operator-pr.md` and follow its process.
